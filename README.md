# ctes_opt
A set of scripts to convert building energy simulation files (EnergyPlus .eso and .epw files) into optimization input files (AMPL model, data, and run files) for the purpose of optimzing cool thermal energy storage within a connected community.

# to do
* [ ] Automate the OpenStudio plant model build for district cooling plants
* [ ] Automate Results capture and plotting
* [ ] Add capability to start workflow from .osm's rather than from .eso's
